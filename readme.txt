Learning how to write unit tests in Angular.
Based on Pluralsight training: Unit Testing in Angular 12 by Joe Eames
Which have obsolete and non-working example here: https://github.com/joeeames/PSAngularUnitTestingCourse.git
So I grabbed recent Tour Of Heroes example, and trying to recreate tests described by Joe Eames.
Source code for Tour Of Heroes: https://angular.io/guide/example-apps-list#tour-of-heroes-completed-application

To run application:
>npm start

To run test:
>npm test

Thank you
